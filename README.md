# 📞 Call Center Data Exploration in Excel

## 📝 Introduction

This project involves the exploration and analysis of call center performance data using Microsoft Excel. The primary goal is to evaluate the efficiency and profitability of call center representatives across different cities based on their engagement time, revenue generated, and satisfaction ratings. The dataset comprises two related tables: one detailing individual call records and the other containing representative details. The project utilizes **Power Pivot** and **DAX** measures to build dynamic reports and dashboards, offering a comprehensive overview of representative performance and call center operations.
